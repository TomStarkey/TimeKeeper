# TimeKeeper
## Introducition
Helps you keep track of your working hours. A simple GUI which includes a stopwatch and an entry for labelling your project.

## Installing dependencies
Before installing dependencies I would recommend creating a virtual environment. This can be done either with ***python -m virtualenv <environmentname>*** or with ***python -m venv <environmentname>***
Third party dependencies for the project can be installed using the powershell command ***pip install -r requirements.txt*** (If this command has not worked then try adding "*python -m*" or "*py -m*" beforehand.)
This uses the *requirements.txt* file included in the repository to install the required dependencies.

## Using the programme
Run gui.py to begin the programme...
